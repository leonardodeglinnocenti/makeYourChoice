## Security measures
1. You cannot force an action by trying to access a page that you are not allowed to access. For example, if you are not logged in and/or you aren't the owner of a survey, you cannot delete it by accessing the "Delete Survey" page and passing the survey id as a parameter in the browser url bar.
2. The Secret Key is passed as an environment variable, so it's not visible in the source code.
3. Before a critical action is performed, a confirmation message is displayed to the user.
4. When a survey is deleted, all the related questions and choices are deleted as well.
5. When a category is deleted, all the related surveys are deleted as well.
6. When a user is deleted, all the related surveys are deleted as well.
7. When a user is deleted, all the related subscriptions are deleted as well.
